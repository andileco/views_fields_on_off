==========

A module containing a Views field that allows users to selectively
show or hide fields at view-time.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

In a View with fields, Add a new field Global: On/Off Form, which allows
display fields (fields not excluded from the display) to be switched on or off.
In the exposed form area of the View display, a list of checkboxes for each
selected field will appear. The user can check the fields to show or hide and
apply it, then the field will be displayed or not displayed when the View
displays! The selection of hidden fields will also exclude the de-selected
fields from Views Data Export.
